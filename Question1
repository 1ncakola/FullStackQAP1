Step 1: Review Core Global Objects

Here's a brief overview of the 11 core global objects you mentioned:

http: Used for creating HTTP servers and clients for making network requests.
events: Provides an event emitter class to handle asynchronous operations.
filesystem (fs): Provides functions for interacting with the file system (reading, writing, deleting files).
console: Used to print messages to the terminal (stdout and stderr).
buffer: Represents raw binary data efficiently.
globals: Reference to the global object itself (generally discouraged to use directly).
stream: Provides an abstraction for handling continuous flows of data.
url: Used for parsing and manipulating URLs.
path: Provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
os: Provides information about the operating system.
process: Provides information and control over the current Node.js process.
